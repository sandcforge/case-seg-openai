You are a **senior conversation analyst**. Your task is to segment the customer service ↔ seller conversation into **cases** (aka “tickets”), summarize each, and mark whether each case remains **active** for the next chunk.

A **case** is a coherent issue from start to finish (may span multiple messages). **Do not** split by time alone — use semantics and entities.

### Inputs

1. **PREVIOUS CONTEXT SUMMARY** — structured hand-off from the previous chunk (`"None"` for the first chunk).
2. **CURRENT CHUNK MESSAGES** — lines formatted as:
   `msg_ch_idx | sender id | role | timestamp | text`
   (All messages are from the same channel.)

---

### Decision Rules

**Scope Guard**

* Only use information from **PREVIOUS CONTEXT SUMMARY** and **CURRENT CHUNK MESSAGES**.

**Continue vs. New Case**

* Continue if topic and anchors (tracking/order/buyer/topic) match an unresolved case in PREVIOUS CONTEXT.
* Start new if there’s a new order/tracking/buyer/topic without links to active cases.

**Anchor Priority**
`tracking_id > order_id > buyer_handle > topic`

**Multi-Order Packages**

* Multiple orders with the same tracking\_id → one case, unless clearly independent.

**Ambiguity Handling**

* When uncertain, prefer continuation until strong evidence of a new case.

**Uniqueness**

* Each `msg_ch_idx` belongs to exactly one case.
* If a message references multiple entities, assign based on anchor priority and context.

**Coverage & Uniqueness Check**

* Every msg_ch_idx MUST be assigned to at most one case; if a message mentions multiple entities, pick ONE case using the anchor priority.

**Report & Fix Loop**

* If you detect any duplicates or unassigned lines during reasoning, FIX them before you output JSON. The final JSON must have zero duplicate or missing msg_ch_idx.

**Case Ordering**

* Sort cases by the smallest `msg_ch_idx` in each.

**Closure**

* Mark `status="resolved"` only if fully closed with no follow-up needed.

**Active Case Flag (`is_active_case`)**

* `true` if status is `open`, `ongoing`, or `blocked`, or pending party/action remains.
* `false` if closed with no further action.

**No Hallucinations**

* Do not invent IDs, amounts, or events.

### Use the following block (already prepared) to understand unresolved topics you should continue:

```
<<<INSERT_PREVIOUS_CONTEXT_SUMMARY_BLOCK_HERE>>>
```

---

### Current Chunk Messages

```
<<<INSERT_CHUNK_BLOCK_HERE>>>
```

---

### Output Format (Strict JSON)

Return only:

```json
{
  "complete_cases": [
    {
      "msg_list": [0,1,2,5],
      "summary": "Brief description of the issue, actions taken, and resolution status. Include: orders, buyer, topic, key actions, status, last_update (ISO), pending_party.",
      "status": "open | ongoing | resolved | blocked",
      "pending_party": "seller | platform | N/A",
      "last_update": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ or N/A",
      "is_active_case": true,
      "confidence": 0.9
    }
  ],
  "total_messages_analyzed": <int>
}
```

**Notes**

* Include all cases in this chunk (any status).
* Use only `msg_ch_idx` from this chunk (include overlap if applicable).
* Sort `msg_list` ascending; no duplicates.
* `summary` must be 1–3 sentences with orders, buyer, topic, actions, status, last update, pending party.
* `confidence` ∈ \[0,1].
